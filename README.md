# Task-Scheduler 📆

A simple SPA that helps with organizing daily tasks! Built in React, Node, Express and MySQL. The objective of this web application is to showcase basic client to server communication using REST API to perfom CRUD functionalities to a database. 


# Future Add-ons 📝
### Front-End ###
* Looking to integerate Redux Toolkit in this application as I build upon it.
  * Currently utilizing hooks to manage state and axios to handle api calls
* Adding addtional components such as a Login/Signup page and history of tasks unique to each user.

### Back-end ### 
* Planning on migrating my express api to git the newest ESM module standards. 
* Current DB design is rather simple  -- looking forward to redesiging the DB upon introducing additional components and layers.


##### A lot has changed since I last looked at React -- changes for the better and a lot cleaner!  #####
